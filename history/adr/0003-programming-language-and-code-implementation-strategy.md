# ADR-0003: Programming Language and Code Implementation Strategy

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-12-13
- **Feature:** 001-ros2-nervous-system
- **Context:** The module needs to establish a consistent approach to code examples that balances educational clarity with practical applicability. This decision affects all code examples, reader comprehension, and the overall learning experience.

<!-- Significance checklist (ALL must be true to justify this ADR)
     1) Impact: Long-term consequence for architecture/platform/security?
     2) Alternatives: Multiple viable options considered with tradeoffs?
     3) Scope: Cross-cutting concern (not an isolated detail)?
     If any are false, prefer capturing as a PHR note instead of an ADR. -->

## Decision

- Language Focus: Python only (rclpy) for consistency
- Code Depth: Complete, runnable code with all dependencies
- Quality Standards: Error handling, type hints, ROS 2 best practices, linting compliance
- Hardware Abstraction: High-level ROS interface focus rather than low-level details

<!-- For technology stacks, list all components:
     - Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
     - Styling: Tailwind CSS v3
     - Deployment: Vercel
     - State Management: React Context (start simple)
-->

## Consequences

### Positive

- Simpler for readers to follow and understand
- Faster development and consistency across examples
- Aligns with target audience preference for rapid prototyping
- Ensures reproducible and practical examples

<!-- Example: Integrated tooling, excellent DX, fast deploys, strong TypeScript support -->

### Negative

- May miss some advanced features available in other languages
- Could limit completeness compared to multi-language approach
- Readers may need additional resources for C++ implementations

<!-- Example: Vendor lock-in to Vercel, framework coupling, learning curve -->

## Alternatives Considered

Alternative A: Multi-language approach (Python + C++)
- Rejected due to complexity and potential confusion for readers

Alternative B: Pseudocode and conceptual examples
- Rejected as it would not ensure reproducibility and practical application

<!-- Group alternatives by cluster:
     Alternative Stack A: Remix + styled-components + Cloudflare
     Alternative Stack B: Vite + vanilla CSS + AWS Amplify
     Why rejected: Less integrated, more setup complexity
-->
